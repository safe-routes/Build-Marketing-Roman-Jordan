            <h1>Making it Home has Never Been Easier</h1>
            <p>Have you ever had a family member go to the store or ballet only to never return?
            You ask your self WHY! WHAT COULD I HAVE DONE! HOW COULD THIS HAPPEN! At Safe Routes,
            we don't want this to happen to any one ever again. Accidents do happen, however, when 
            accidents happen in a given area there is now a trend established; A mark on the map if you will.
            What we have done is taken all of these marks and hooked them up to Deep Learning, an A.I. 
            program, to help uncover some of these accident trends  and patterns in an effort to help
            families and people choose the safest, most efficient route possible. Safety Saves Lives!
